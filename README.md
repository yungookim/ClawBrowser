# ClawBrowser  
**Your browser just got claws, a brain, and a serious attitude.**

Imagine your boring old browser hooked up with OpenClaw’s wild AI and had the coolest baby ever.  
**ClawBrowser: the AI browser on steroids.**  
It doesn’t wait for orders. It watches, remembers, and *claws* through your tabs while you chill.

### Not Another Sleepy AI Browser
Comet and Atlas? Cute. They react.  
ClawBrowser *anticipates*.  
Spotted you hunting flights for 20 minutes? Boom — price comparison drops in.  
Form you’ve filled before? Already pre-filled.  
It’s proactive AF.

They forget the second you close a tab.  
ClawBrowser never forgets.  
Local files (SOUL.md, USER.md, IDENTITY.md) keep your vibe forever: no window seats, always CC your boss, your exact writing style. Encrypted. Yours. Only.

They sleep.  
ClawBrowser reflects every midnight, levels up overnight, and wakes up smarter.  
No other browser does that. Period.

Locked to one company? Lame.  
ClawBrowser lets you mix OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, Ollama, or full-local llama.cpp.  
Swap brains anytime. Your rules.

Closed-source data vampires? Hard pass.  
ClawBrowser is 100% open source (MIT), 10 MB tiny, and every single byte stays on your machine.

### Why It Feels Like Magic
- Logs in, fills forms, drags data between tabs like a boss  
- Voice that runs locally — talk naturally, nothing leaves your laptop  
- Remembers everything, gets better every single day  
- Handles “book my Tokyo flight,” “pay the electric bill,” or “crush this LinkedIn job hunt” in seconds
